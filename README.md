# Multi-Source Graph Fusion for Remote Sensing Regression

A dual-graph neural network framework that fuses spatial topology and ecological feature graphs for above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction from multi-source remote sensing data.

## Overview

This project proposes a **segmented dual-graph fusion architecture** combining:
- **TKG** (Topological Knowledge Graph): spatial KNN graph processed by GAT
- **EKG** (Ecological Knowledge Graph): cosine-similarity feature graph processed by GCN
- **Segmented training**: threshold-based regime splitting to handle heterogeneous biomass distributions

The framework is validated on EuroSAT RGB and real-world multi-year remote sensing data (NDVI + ESA AGB + DEM) over the Tibetan Plateau.

## Key Technical Contributions

1. **Dual-graph fusion**: TKG captures geographic proximity; EKG captures semantic similarity between land patches — fused via learned attention weights.
2. **Segmented modeling**: A pre-trained RF initializer assigns each sample to a biomass regime before graph training, avoiding label leakage at test time.
3. **Strict OOD evaluation**: Spatial buffer-based train/test split ensures no geographic overlap, testing true generalization.

## Requirements
